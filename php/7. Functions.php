/**
 * User-defined functions
 * 
 * A function may be defined using syntax such as the following:
 */


/**
 * Function arguments
 * 
 * Information may be passed to functions via the argument list, which is a comma-delimited list of 
 * expressions. The arguments are evaluated from left to right, before the function is actually 
 * called (eager evaluation).
 */


/**
 * Returning values
 * 
 * Values are returned by using the optional return statement. Any type may be returned, 
 * including arrays and objects. This causes the function to end its execution immediately 
 * and pass control back to the line from which it was called
 */


/**
 * Variable functions
 * 
 * PHP supports the concept of variable functions. This means that if a variable name has parentheses 
 * appended to it, PHP will look for a function with the same name as whatever the variable evaluates 
 * to, and will attempt to execute it. Among other things, this can be used to implement callbacks, 
 * function tables, and so forth.
 * 
 */



/**
 * Anonymous functions
 * 
 * Anonymous functions, also known as closures, allow the creation of functions which have no 
 * specified name. They are most useful as the value of callable parameters, but they have many 
 * other uses.
 */


/**
 * Arrow Functions
 * 
 * Arrow functions were introduced in PHP 7.4 as a more concise syntax for anonymous functions.
